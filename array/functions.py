# LeetCode 41.
# 4. Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space.
# In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates
# and negative numbers as well.
#
# For example, the input [3, 4, -1, 1] should give 2. The input [1, 2, 0] should give 3.
#
# You can modify the input array in-place.
#
# ANSWER:
# 1. We divide the array into 2 parts such that the first part consists of only non-negative numbers. Say we have
# the starting index as 0 and the ending index as lo (inclusive).
# 2. We traverse the array from index 0 to lo. We take the absolute value of the element at that index - say the
# value is x.
#  a. If x > lo + 1 or x == 0, we do nothing.
#  b. Otherwise, we make the sign of the element at index x - 1 negative. We subtract 1 because we want to map
#     positive numbers to array indices, and indices start from 0.
# 3. Finally, we traverse the array once more from index 0 to lo. In case we encounter a positive element at some
# index, we output index + 1. This is the answer. However, if we do not encounter any positive element, it means that
# integers 1 to lo occur in the array. We output lo + 1.

# 44. We can determine how "out of order" an array A is by counting the number of inversions it has. Two elements
# A[i] and A[j] form an inversion if A[i] > A[j] but i < j. That is, a smaller element appears after a larger element.
#
# Given an array, count the number of inversions it has. Do this faster than O(N^2) time.
#
# You may assume each element in the array is distinct.
#
# For example, a sorted list has zero inversions. The array [2, 4, 1, 3, 5] has three inversions:
# (2, 1), (4, 1), and (4, 3). The array [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] has ten inversions: every distinct pair forms an inversion.
#
# ANSWER: We merge sort the array and count inversions during the merge process. If for i in [0, len(left)) and
# j in [0, len(right)), left(i) > right(j), then all elements after index i are also greater than right(j) and
# count in the inversions.
#
# Time complexity: O(n log n). Space complexity: O(n), since two arrays of same length as the input are created.

# LeetCode 53.
# 49. Given an array of numbers, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of the array.
#
# For example, given the array [34, -50, 42, 14, -5, 86], the maximum sum would be 137, since we would take elements
# 42, 14, -5, and 86.
#
# Given the array [-5, -1, -8, -9], the maximum sum would be 0, since we would not take any elements.
#
# Do this in O(N) time.
#
# ANSWER: We use Kadane's algorithm that takes advantage of the optimal substructure of the problem.
#
# Given array A, let M[i] be the maximum sum of the subarray ending at index i. M[i+1] could be obtained by extending
# the M[i] with A[i+1]. Another possibility is that M[i] is a very small value (perhaps many of the elements are
# negative integers), and we are better off just taking A[i+1] by itself.
# Thus, the recurrence relation is:
#
# M[i] = max{ M[i - 1] + A[i], A[i] }, âˆ€ i = 1 to n - 1
#      = 0 if i = 0.
#
# Basically, we are trying to figure out if to start a new streak, or continue the current one.
# If the array contains only negative numbers, the maximum sum would be zero, since we would not take any elements.
#
# However, since each value of M[i] is only computed once, because this algorithm doesn't exhibit overlapping
# subproblems (recomputing the same values over and over). Thus, it may not strictly be called dynamic programming.

# LeetCode 33.
# 58. An sorted array of integers was rotated an unknown number of times.
#
# Given such an array, find the index of the element in the array in faster than linear time. If the element doesn't
# exist in the array, return null.
#
# For example, given the array [13, 18, 25, 2, 8, 10] and the element 8, return 4 (the index of 8 in the array).
#
# You can assume all the integers in the array are unique.
#
# ANSWER: In the rotated array, the largest element is potentially not at the end. Observe that all the elements after
# the max element are sorted. Thus, if we take the middle element, and compare it to the end elements, we can tell
# which side the max element is on relative to the middle element. All the elements on the other side of middle that
# max is NOT on are sorted. We check if the target element falls on the sorted side, and if yes, we binary search
# there. Else we search on the non-sorted side (the side containing max).

#
# For example, if the list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and K is 9, then it should return [2, 3, 4].
#
# ANSWER: We simply grow the current window until its sum exceeds k. Then we reduce from the left until the sum drops

# [3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2]. Try solving this without creating a copy of the list.
# How many swap or move operations do you need?
#
# ANSWER: For a O(1) space solution, we need to rotate the list in place. Observe that when the list is reversed,
# and then the first k elements, and then the remaining n - k elements are reversed, we end up with a list rotated
# right by k positions.
#
# Example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 3

# LeetCode 188.
# 130. Given an array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order and an integer k,
# return the maximum profit you can make from k buys and sells. You must buy the stock before you can sell it,
# and you must sell the stock before you can buy it again.
#
# For example, given k = 2 and the array [5, 2, 4, 0, 1], you should return 3.

# ANSWER: Assuming stocks can't be sold and purchased on the same day, on any day, there are two options:
# 1. Make no transactions; the max profit on that day is the same as the previous day
# 2. Sell; the max profit on that day is the difference of prices between that day and a previous day when the
# stock was purchased, plus the max profit made until the buying day with one less transaction
#
# If there are n prices, the time complexity is O(n^2 * k). We can improve the time complexity by eliminating the
# inner loop for determining the profit on sale if we store the profit for buying up to day - 2. Then the profit
# for buying up to day - 1 can be calculated in constant time.
#
# Space complexity is O(nk). This can be improved too by observing that we only need the last two rows and one
# column to calculate to profit for today (provided profit for buying up to day - 2 is stored).

# LeetCode 969.
# 147. Given a list, sort it using this method: reverse(lst, i, j), which reverses lst from i to j.
#
# ANSWER: This is known as Pancake sorting. At each iteration, we find the index of the maximum element among the

# index where nums[i] would be after the array is completely sorted. Clearly, j starts from the last index of the
# array, and gets decremented by 1 at each iteration.
#
# Time complexity: Finding the max index is an O(n) operation. Since reverse does n/2 swaps, and we do 2 reversals,
# there are O(n) swaps. Thus, we do O(n) work at each operation, and O(n^2) work for the whole algorithm.

# LeetCode 315.
# 165. Given an array of integers, return a new array where each element in the new array is the number of smaller
# elements to the right of that element in the original input array.
#
# For example, given the array [3, 4, 9, 6, 1], return [1, 1, 2, 1, 0], since:
#
# There is 1 smaller element to the right of 3
# There is 1 smaller element to the right of 4
# There are 2 smaller elements to the right of 9
# There is 1 smaller element to the right of 6
# There are no smaller elements to the right of 1
#
# ANSWER: We can solve this problem trivially in O(n^2) time by counting the smaller numbers to the right of each
# number. Can we do better?
# Observe that if we traverse two sorted subsequences from the end, if the current number in the left array is greater
# than the current one in the right array, the number in the left array has len(right) smaller elements to its right in
# the original array. If the right array is empty, all the numbers in it were no smaller than the current number in the
# left array.
# This is essentially the merge step in merge sort, except instead of building the merged array by appending
# non-decreasing numbers, we build it by prepending non-increasing numbers to the left.
#
# Time complexity: O(n log(n)). We create a bunch of intermediate arrays, but this can be eliminated by passing around
# an array of equal length as the original unsorted array.

# 166. Implement a 2D iterator class. It will be initialized with an array of arrays, and should implement the following
# methods:
#
# next(): returns the next element in the array of arrays. If there are no more elements, raise an exception.
# has_next(): returns whether or not the iterator still has elements left.
# For example, given the input [[1, 2], [3], [], [4, 5, 6]], calling next() repeatedly should output 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
#
# Do not use flatten or otherwise clone the arrays. Some of the arrays can be empty.

# LeetCode 48.
# 168. Given an N by N matrix, rotate it by 90 degrees clockwise.
#
# For example, given the following matrix:
#
# [[1, 2, 3],
#  [4, 5, 6],
#  [7, 8, 9]]
# you should return:
#
# [[7, 4, 1],
#  [8, 5, 2],
#  [9, 6, 3]]
# Follow-up: What if you couldn't use any extra space?
#
# ANSWER: Imagine the matrix like an onion with multiple layers. Observe that the number of layers is simply n // 2.
# The rotation happens layer by layer. At each iteration, we swap 4 elements from the current layer.

# Consider a big party where a log register for each guest's entry and exit times is maintained. Find the time at which
# there are maximum guests in the party. Note that entries in register are not in any order.

# For example:
# [(1, 4), (2, 5), (9, 12), (5, 9), (5, 12)]
# First guest arrives at 1 and leaves at 4,
# second guest arrives at 2 and leaves at 5, and so on.
# There are maximum 3 guests at time 5.
#
# ANSWER: The problem boils down to the maximum overlap of the following line segments, where the beginning of a line
# segment indicates the entry time of a guest, and the end indicates their exit. We can see that three lines overlap
# at 5, and as well as 9. We will return the first answer.
# To do this, we convert the register into a list of entry and exit events, and mark an entry by 1, and an exit by -1.
# Then we sort the events based on the times, and if the times are equal, we put an entry before an exit. For the
# example above, we get [(1, 1), (2, 1), (4, -1), (5, 1), (5, 1), (5, -1), (9, 1), (9, -1), (12, -1), (12, -1). Then
# we simply traverse this list adding up the 1's and -1's, keeping track of the maximum value at all times.
#         ------------------
#         ---------
#                 ----------
#   -------
# -------
# 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
#
# Time complexity:
# Conversion of the register to list of entry and exit events: O(n).
# Sorting of the events: O(n log(n)).
# Overall, O(n log(n)).
#
# A variation of the problem is as follows:
# 171. You are given a list of data entries that represent entries and exits of groups of people into a building.
# An entry looks like this:
#
# {"timestamp": 1526579928, count: 3, "type": "enter"}
#
# This means 3 people entered the building. An exit looks like this:
#
# {"timestamp": 1526580382, count: 2, "type": "exit"}
#
# This means that 2 people exited the building. timestamp is in Unix time.
#
# Find the busiest period in the building, that is, the time with the most people in the building. Return it as a pair
# of (start, end) timestamps. You can assume the building always starts off and ends up empty, i.e. with 0 people
# inside.

# LeetCode 223/836.
# 185. Given two rectangles on a 2D graph, return the area of their intersection. If the rectangles don't intersect,
# return 0.
#
# For example, given the following rectangles:
#
# {
#     "top_left": (1, 4),
#     "dimensions": (3, 3) # width, height
# }
# and
#
# {
#     "top_left": (0, 5),
#     "dimensions": (4, 3) # width, height
# }
# return 6.
#
# ANSWER: Refer to the diagram "test/rectangles.jpg" for some examples.
# Every rectangle has two unique x coordinates, and two unique y coordinates. In order for the rectangles to
# intersect, at least one x coordinate of a rectangle must be within the x coordinates of the other one (both x
# coordinates of the first may be within the x coordinates of the other one if the first one is completely contained
# in the second one). Thus, if all the x coordinates are sorted, the middle two give us the x-range of the intersection.
# Same argument applies to y coordinates.
# Note that if the rectangles don't intersect but have sides that touch, the intersecting range is zero.

# LeetCode 3.
# 189. Given an array of elements, return the length of the longest subarray where all its elements are distinct.
#
# For example, given the array [5, 1, 3, 5, 2, 3, 4, 1], return 5 as the longest subarray of distinct elements is
# [5, 2, 3, 4, 1].
#
# ANSWER: We solve this by using a sliding window that contains only distinct numbers. At each iteration, we extend
# the window on the right; if the current element is one that is already present in the window, we move the left
# boundary past the duplicate element. The longest distinct subarray is the longest of all the subarrays we see.
#
# Time complexity: O(n), since all the operations at each iteration are constant time.

# LeetCode 918.
# 190. Given a circular array, compute its maximum subarray sum in O(n) time. A subarray can be empty, and in this
# case the sum is 0.
#
# For example, given [8, -1, 3, 4], return 15 as we choose the numbers 3, 4, and 8 where the 8 is obtained from
# wrapping around.
#
# Given [-4, 5, 1, 0], return 6 as we choose the numbers 5 and 1.
#
# ANSWER: For an array A of length N, there are two cases of the maximum subarray:
#   1. The maximum subarray lies between 0 <= i < N
#   2. The maximum subarray wraps around, so part of it k < i < N, and the rest 0 <= j <= k, for some k.
#
#   In the second case, if the total sum of A is S, and the maximum subarray sum is S1, then the sum of the subarray
#   between k and i is given by S2 = S - S1. Or, S1 = S - S2. Since S is fixed, S1 is maximized if S2 is minimized.
#
#   Thus, we find the maximum subarray sum for case 1, and the minimum subarray sum for case 2, using Kadane's
#   algorithm. The result is given by the maximum of the case 1 sum and S - S2.
#
# Time complexity O(N).
def max_sum_circular_arr(nums: Sequence[int]) -> int:
    greatest: int = -sys.maxsize + 1

    for i in nums:
        x += i
        greatest = max(greatest, x)

        x = max(x, 0)

        y += i

        # If running_sum is positive, we are better off taking just the next number
