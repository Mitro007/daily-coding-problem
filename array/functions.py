# LeetCode 41.
# 4. Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space.
# In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates
# and negative numbers as well.
#
# For example, the input [3, 4, -1, 1] should give 2. The input [1, 2, 0] should give 3.
#
# You can modify the input array in-place.
#
# ANSWER:
# 1. We divide the array into 2 parts such that the first part consists of only non-negative numbers. Say we have
# the starting index as 0 and the ending index as lo (inclusive).
# 2. We traverse the array from index 0 to lo. We take the absolute value of the element at that index - say the
# value is x.
#  a. If x > lo + 1 or x == 0, we do nothing.
#  b. Otherwise, we make the sign of the element at index x - 1 negative. We subtract 1 because we want to map
#     positive numbers to array indices, and indices start from 0.
# 3. Finally, we traverse the array once more from index 0 to lo. In case we encounter a positive element at some
# index, we output index + 1. This is the answer. However, if we do not encounter any positive element, it means that
# integers 1 to lo occur in the array. We output lo + 1.

# 44. We can determine how "out of order" an array A is by counting the number of inversions it has. Two elements
# A[i] and A[j] form an inversion if A[i] > A[j] but i < j. That is, a smaller element appears after a larger element.
#
# Given an array, count the number of inversions it has. Do this faster than O(N^2) time.
#
# You may assume each element in the array is distinct.
#
# For example, a sorted list has zero inversions. The array [2, 4, 1, 3, 5] has three inversions:
# (2, 1), (4, 1), and (4, 3). The array [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] has ten inversions: every distinct pair forms an inversion.
#
# ANSWER: We merge sort the array and count inversions during the merge process. If for i in [0, len(left)) and
# j in [0, len(right)), left(i) > right(j), then all elements after index i are also greater than right(j) and
# count in the inversions.
#
# Time complexity: O(n log n). Space complexity: O(n), since two arrays of same length as the input are created.

# LeetCode 53.
# 49. Given an array of numbers, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of the array.
#
# For example, given the array [34, -50, 42, 14, -5, 86], the maximum sum would be 137, since we would take elements
# 42, 14, -5, and 86.
#
# Given the array [-5, -1, -8, -9], the maximum sum would be 0, since we would not take any elements.
#
# Do this in O(N) time.
#
# ANSWER: We use Kadane's algorithm that takes advantage of the optimal substructure of the problem.
#
# Given array A, let M[i] be the maximum sum of the subarray ending at index i. M[i+1] could be obtained by extending
# the M[i] with A[i+1]. Another possibility is that M[i] is a very small value (perhaps many of the elements are
# negative integers), and we are better off just taking A[i+1] by itself.
# Thus, the recurrence relation is:
#
# M[i] = max{ M[i - 1] + A[i], A[i] }, âˆ€ i = 1 to n - 1
#      = 0 if i = 0.
#
# Basically, we are trying to figure out if to start a new streak, or continue the current one.
# If the array contains only negative numbers, the maximum sum would be zero, since we would not take any elements.
#
# However, since each value of M[i] is only computed once, because this algorithm doesn't exhibit overlapping
# subproblems (recomputing the same values over and over). Thus, it may not strictly be called dynamic programming.

# LeetCode 33.
# 58. An sorted array of integers was rotated an unknown number of times.
#
# Given such an array, find the index of the element in the array in faster than linear time. If the element doesn't
# exist in the array, return null.
#
# For example, given the array [13, 18, 25, 2, 8, 10] and the element 8, return 4 (the index of 8 in the array).
#
# You can assume all the integers in the array are unique.
#
# ANSWER: In the rotated array, the largest element is potentially not at the end. Observe that all the elements after
# the max element are sorted. Thus, if we take the middle element, and compare it to the end elements, we can tell
# which side the max element is on relative to the middle element. All the elements on the other side of middle that
# max is NOT on are sorted. We check if the target element falls on the sorted side, and if yes, we binary search
# there. Else we search on the non-sorted side (the side containing max).

# 102. Given a list of integers and a number K, return which contiguous elements of the list sum to K.
#
# For example, if the list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and K is 9, then it should return [2, 3, 4].
#
# ANSWER: We simply grow the current window until its sum exceeds k. Then we reduce from the left until the sum drops

# LeetCode 189.
# 126. Write a function that rotates a list by k elements. For example, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] rotated by two becomes
# [3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2]. Try solving this without creating a copy of the list.
# How many swap or move operations do you need?
#
# ANSWER: For a O(1) space solution, we need to rotate the list in place. Observe that when the list is reversed,
# and then the first k elements, and then the remaining n - k elements are reversed, we end up with a list rotated
# right by k positions.
#
# Example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 3
# Reverse list: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
# Reverse k = 3 elements: [3, 4, 5, 2, 1]

# LeetCode 188.
# 130. Given an array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order and an integer k,
# return the maximum profit you can make from k buys and sells. You must buy the stock before you can sell it,
# and you must sell the stock before you can buy it again.
#
# For example, given k = 2 and the array [5, 2, 4, 0, 1], you should return 3.

# ANSWER: Assuming stocks can't be sold and purchased on the same day, on any day, there are two options:
# 1. Make no transactions; the max profit on that day is the same as the previous day
# 2. Sell; the max profit on that day is the difference of prices between that day and a previous day when the
# stock was purchased, plus the max profit made until the buying day with one less transaction
#
# If there are n prices, the time complexity is O(n^2 * k). We can improve the time complexity by eliminating the
# inner loop for determining the profit on sale if we store the profit for buying up to day - 2. Then the profit
# for buying up to day - 1 can be calculated in constant time.
#
# Space complexity is O(nk). This can be improved too by observing that we only need the last two rows and one
# column to calculate to profit for today (provided profit for buying up to day - 2 is stored).

# ANSWER: Let dp[n] be the min number of coins required to make n cents. We can't make any amount with coins that

# 144. Given an array of numbers and an index i, return the index of the nearest larger number of the number at index i,

# nearest larger integer, then return null.
#
# Follow-up: If you can preprocess the array, can you do this in constant time?
#
# ANSWER: Can solve in linear time by scanning both ways from i. If we preprocess the array to partition it around i,
